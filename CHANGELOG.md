All notable project-level changes should be recorded here.

The project is pre-1.0. Breaking changes may occur, but they should be documented when they affect users, operators or contributors.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Current-state architecture, deployment and development documentation.
- Chinese documentation mirror under `zh-cn/` for project docs.
- DGX Spark model-serving guidance and benchmark evidence.
- Open-source project files: license, contribution guide, security policy, support guide, code of conduct and GitHub templates.

### Changed

- Replaced old planning, audit and handoff documents with current maintainable docs.
- Consolidated intent routing, messaging/scheduling, browser, document,
  integration and WebChat documentation into six current component guides plus
  one documentation index; removed 29 completed or superseded document pairs.
- Excluded runtime skill packages from the bilingual documentation mirror because skills evolve independently.

### Validated

- WebChat production build.
- Gateway skill registry test.
- Docker Compose config validation.
- `scripts/doctor.sh`.
- Markdown link and language-switch checks.
